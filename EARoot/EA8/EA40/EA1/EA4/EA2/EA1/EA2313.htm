	<div class="ObjectDetailsNotes">One of the best tools I&#39;ve found for sorting out Market Type choices is derived from a military operations research theory called the New Lanchester Strategy. (These ideas have been put to use in marketing strategy in Japan, but they have always lost something in the translation by the time they have arrived in the United States. I don&#39;t swear I can derive the New Lanchester formulas and prove the theorems, but the results when applied to markets come out looking uncannily like the real world.) The New Lanchester Strategy suggests a few simple rules companies can use to analyze an existing market: If a single company has 74% of the market, the market has become an effective monopoly. For a startup, that&#39;s an unassailable position for a head-on assault. (Think Microsoft.) If the combined market share for the market leader and second-ranking company is greater than 74% and the first company is within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means the market is held by a duopoly. This is also an unassailable position for a startup to attack. (In the telecom sector, Cisco and Juniper&#39;s share of the core router market fits this description.) If a company has 41% market share and at least 1.7 times the market share of the next largest company, it is the market leader. For a startup, this, too, is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a clear market leader are, for a startup, an opportunity for resegementation. If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26% market share, the market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the company rankings. Here there may be some entry opportunities. If the biggest player has less than 26% market share, it has no real impact in influencing the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market find these the easiest to penetrate. One more rule in the New Lanchester Strategy is relevant for a startup. If you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing budget of that dominant player. (Ouch, so much for going head-on with Microsoft.) In a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but you still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of the company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market you must steal market share from an incumbent, hence the analogy to war.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thinking about this strategy, many of the rules marketers learn painfully in the field now make a lot more sense. In looking at any existing market, your startup is the weakest player with the least resources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You want to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your agility. (Both Bill Davidow in his seminal work High Technology Marketing and Geoff Moore in Crossing the Chasm articulated the same type of rules for startups and new products based on observation and experience. Now we can derive them directly.) Now that you know the rules, what do they mean for choosing Market Type? Let&#39;s say you are going after a well-defined existing market. If there is a dominant player with more than 74% market share, do not attack that market head-on. Why? Because of the rule that says you need three times the resources of the market leader, you&#39;ll be out of business shortly. Instead, target your attack at the point where your limited resources can make a difference. You will segment the existing market to create a submarket where your product can be unique or substantially different. Or if you can create an entirely new market; you can define a space the market leader does not address. Your goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer. It could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer base. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing on the competitors&#8217; weak points until you have a battle you can win. You know your segmentation is correct when you have created a niche where you can be No. 1. Remember, any company can take customers away from any other company&#8212;if it can define the battle. If the dominant player has between 26% and 74% market share, pick your battles carefully. Remember the cost of a head-on attack: Three times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times a competitor in a crowded market. Most startups don&#39;t have access to those financial resources. Therefore, resegmenting the market or creating a new market is almost always the default when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for nipping at the heels of an entrenched competitor can be used here: Most of them were invented 2,500 years ago by Sun Tzu&#8217; and described in his book, The Art of War: &#8220;All warfare is based on deception. If your enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched, fight and if not split and re-evaluate.&#8221; If there is no single company with more than 26% market share in an existing market, then the startup gods have smiled on you. You can still choose to resegment the market, but the cost of entry is low and the market is ripe for innovation. It is yours to lose. What if there are no competitors? What if after talking to all your early customers you continue to hear, &#8220;There&#39;s nothing else like what your company is offering?&#8221; What if after looking at all the quantitative data you can&#39;t find other companies with comparable products? Congratulations: You are creating an entirely new market. A company creating a new market is radically different from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are no market-share battles with competitors, there are also no existing customers. This means even an infinite demand-creation budget at the point of product launch will not garner market share. Creating a new market is about long term customer education and adoption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the long-term and deep-pocket commitment necessary in a new market, why not just position the company as one resegmenting an existing market? That can be a viable option, but the one piece of great news about creating an entirely new market is once the market is established, as the market leader you are guaranteed at least 41% market share. You can certainly lose that share, and your success will attract other competitors, but the market is yours to start. (The notion of a new market is also tantalizing because of the misunderstood and much-abused phrase &#8220;first mover advantage.&#8221; We&#39;ll talk about that later in this chapter.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</div>
