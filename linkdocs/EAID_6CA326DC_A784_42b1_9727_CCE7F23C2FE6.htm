<div align="left"><font size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt"><br /></span></font></div><div align="left"><font size="2"><span style=" font-size:10pt">As you can see, a book retailing for $20 would net our publishing company $7 after everyone in the channel took his cut. 
From this $7, the publisher must pay the author a royalty, market the book, pay for the printing and binding, contribute to 
overhead, and realize a profit. Out of the $20 a customer pays, there&rsquo;s only a dollar or two for the author! No wonder 
authors are ditching print and going directly to e-books. Channel discounts are only the first step in examining how 
money flows in a complex distribution channel. For example, in the book channel and many others (software, media, 
more), sales are on a consignment basis with 100 percent return rights. This means your product (the unsold books in the 
example) can be returned to your company for full credit (and to add insult to injury, you have to pay the return freight 
for returned products). Why is this a problem?</span></font></div>
